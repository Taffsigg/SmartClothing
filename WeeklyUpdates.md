4. start communicating with ADC module/microcontroller
5. creat the ecg and comporator on a solder board while I wait for the arrival of the PCB board

### Week of 9/30
Ervin Lopez - Microcontroller and Power Subsystem
1. Tested bluetooth connection with software and tried to improve it by attempting communication protocols other than OBEX OBject Push.
2. Ran tests using the 16-bit ADC purchased during 403. Discovered it was broken and placed an order for a new one.

Michael Jimenez ECG Subsytems
1. Waiting on arrival of PCB Boards from ZACHARY  
2. Created Soldorable Breadboard for ECG and it is not working
3. Decided to use PCBGO GO to order PCB Boards
### Week of 10/07
Michael Jimenez ECG Subsytems
1. THE ECG Board Arrived and soldered components
2. Amplifiers are not working as planned. I have decided to reorder amplifiers that were used last semester from AD620 to INA2128

### Week of 10/14
Michael Jimenez ECG Subsytems
1. Soldered a Comporator on a Protoboard and noise issues  were detected on the board
2. Order PCB Boards on PCB GO GO
